# Predicting Fish Weight

Find the best model using 2 variables to predict Perch weight, and compare this to the best overall model.

## Perch

```{r}
perch = filter(fish, Species == 'Perch')
```


```{r}
modelPerch = regsubsets(Weight ~ Length1 + Length2 + Length3 + Height + Width, data = perch)
summary(modelPerch)
```

## best 2 variable predictors would be height and width

```{r}
best2Perch = lm(Weight ~ Height + Width, data=perch )
summary(best2Perch)
```

P value is .00000000000000022
